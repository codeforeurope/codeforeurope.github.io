## What is Code for Europe?

The partners in Code for Europe strives to solve local civic challenges with agile temporary teams of developers to create solutions that are easily reusable in other European cities. Our cities need to become smarter and the public sector needs to make use of innovation to stay ahead and create sustainable solutions to civic challenges.

By partnering technology experts with city halls we hope to create a code for Europe; using technology and open data to make our cities more efficient and sustainable.

## What is our aim?

We are on a quest to help European cities become smart. We promote the release of
open data and the sharing of existing solutions and source code.

## Who is involved?

* Various partners in different European countries
* Cities and authorities identify civic challenges, that could host fellows and provide access to relevant data and experts
* Fellows and partners create interoperable solutions and become an agent of change for cities, authorities and countries.
