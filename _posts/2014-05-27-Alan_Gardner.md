Alan Gardner is a developer who has built software for Fortune 50 companies, international banks, social networking sites and even New York fashion houses (despite appearing to get dressed in the middle of a hedge). He loves to see what creative and enquiring minds can do when given access to interesting and rich data sets, and has a passion for helping people through the use of technology.

On the rare occasions that heâ€™s not hunched over a keyboard, he loves to spend time with his family and their dog on the beach near their home in Portobello.
