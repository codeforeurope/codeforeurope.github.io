Ílhan, Adiyaman, who wants to become a computer engineer while he was a little kid living in a southern city of Turkey, realised his dreams and graduated from Istanbul Technical University with a degree in Computer Engineering in 2012. He has developed several web and desktop applications by using many programming languages since he was in high school. Trying new technologies with new ideas is his indispensable passion.

After reaching a huge success in the application market with a mobile transportation application for Istanbul which is created by him and his colleagues from the university, he had decided to continue his career as a mobile application developer. Last year, his team was the winner of Hackathonist’13 which is an award winning event as an activity of CitySDK in Istanbul with a trip planner mobile application that can be reused by other European cities as well. They also had attend open data hackathon event this year March in Manchester, UK and won another open data challenge with another application about recycling. He is happy to be a part of the Code for Europe project and looks forward to discuss with other fellows about new ideas on open data.
