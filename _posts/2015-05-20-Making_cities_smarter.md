Berlin’s Civic Startup allryder has one goal: making cities smarter. Founded in 2014 by MaximNohroudi, Tom Kirschbaum and Stefan Kellner, the urban mobility app has ever since pursued the objective to give its users the best routes. Due to its intuitive user interface, beautiful design and formidable functionality and features, allryder has proven to be a highly popular and cherished public transport app.

Situated in Berlin’s Startup Centre, allryder has been focusing on German cities and gradually pushed boundaries towards Switzerland, Austria, the UK and Ireland.

The allryder team’s big plus has always been its internationality. Profound expertise, respective domestic insights and passionate determination have helped to build a vital, exceptional app. The gorgeous design and intuitive user interface constitute the perfect everyday companion.

allryder is constantly looking for the next challenge in order to improve urban transport and innovative mobility solutions around the globe. Accordingly, starting in Istanbul felt like the perfect next destination for a cutting-edge and ambitious startup allryder is.

Turkey’s largest city Istanbul offers one interesting mode of transport that is slightly different from what society in Central Europe is used to. A vast majority of people use the unique minibuses, which help thousands of passengers to get around the city every day. In Istanbul’s complex navigation system, minibuses turn out to be a highly popular transport mode. The “shared taxis”, less expensive and faster than other means of transportation, run a pre-determined route, with people getting on or off the minibus wherever they might want.

Our operational team in Istanbul as well as the on-site crowdsourcing are the beating heart of allryder’s first steps in Turkey’s metropolis. Local crowdsourcing will provide scalable solutions to other emerging cities and will enable allryder to apply its findings in many more cities in which we can really make a difference.

What makes an app great is its users. Which is why the citizen engagement is so crucial. For Istanbul and its unique minibus situation, this element will be of great importance. With allryder, you will be able to move around the city in the best possible and most stylish manner. In addition, users can report traffic information, give feedback whether the routes are correct as well as access information that hasn’t been digitalized before.

It is the app Istanbul’s public transport has been waiting for. Together, we can make a difference. allryder-mockup-02How? With the citizens’ support – reporting on traffic information, checking on the routes’ accuracy – we are able to digitalize the so far analog transport. City dwellers who are willing to contribute will take an active part in making cities smarter, more attractive and fun. Together, we can have an exciting impact on how commuting of thousands of people in the city becomes easier.
