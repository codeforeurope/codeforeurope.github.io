    <p class="headline">Code for Europe is a network of ICT professionals, developers and designers that create digital services for communities and cities.</p>
    <p>We do this in order to solve real, human problems in a reusable, flexible and inclusive way. We empower local communities to build, share and adapt civic tech. We solve local challenges by profiting from the shared experience of an international network of likeminded fellows.

        <h1>For cities and (local) governments</h1>
        <p>Coders can help cities and governments collaborate bottom-up in innovation. Code for Europe promotes and facilitates collaborative in-house development of software solutions between local chapters/ fellows and government. We connect people to share knowledge, experience and code.</p>
        <h2>Support a chapter</h2>
        <p>An active community of coders working on apps and data services that create value to the people living in your city. We are working on a whitepaper on how to support these chapters. Interested?</p>
        <h2>Fellowships</h2>
        <p>A small team of experienced designers and developers that work within government resolving problems with innovative solutions and educating the government workforce on technology.</p>
